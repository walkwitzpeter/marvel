		<h3>Release Information</h3>

		While it is not the first movie in the Marvel timeline, it is very 
		close. Iron Man belongs to Phase One of the Marvel timeline so it being 
		released first didn't cause any storyline trouble. Iron Man was a huge 
		success grossing over &dollar;585 million and winning multiple awards. 
		People loved Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. Because of his performance 
		in the first Iron Man, Downey, went on to play Iron Man in every Marvel 
		movie in which he appeared.</p>

		<h3>Plot Line</h3>
		<p>In the movie, Downey plays the character, Tony Stark, the real name of 
		the man who wears the Iron Man suit. Stark is a super cocky, rich, yet 
		brilliant young man who designs, builds, and sells ultra-modern weapons to the 
		United States government. In the movie, Stark is abducted and held captive by 
		terrosists after they attacked a military convoy Stark was in after 
		demonstrating a new missile of his. In captivity, the terrorists force Stark to
		build assemble the weapons of his company that they got their hands on. Stark 
		secretely builds a prototype Iron Man suit and fights his way out. This was life 
		changing for Stark as he nearly lost his life and was awoken by the fact that 
		his weapons were in the hands of terrorists. He halts all weapon sales by his 
		company and watches as his company falls apart from within. He finds out of a 
		village that was taken over by terrorists using his weapons and flies there in 
		his new Iron Man suit and frees the people. So, from now on Stark is 
		transitioning to being Iron Man full time. However, the remnants of his first 
		prototype suit got in the hands of terrorists and soon they may have a rival 
		weapon to the suit.</p> 

		<h3>Impact on Future Marvel Movies</h3>
		<p>Since Iron Man was such a success Marvel began releasing more movies at a 
		rapid rate. Since Iron Man's release in 2008 Marvel has released a total of 
		25 movies and counting. Iron has two more movies of his own and is a main 
		character in the Marvel Avengers movies. Iron Man paved the way for the 
		success of Marvel movies.</p>
