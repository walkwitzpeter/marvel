		<h2>Plot Line</h2>
		Infinity War was the massive battle between all the Avengers and the ultimate villain Thanos. Thanos was on the hunt to collect all of the Infinity Stones. The Infinity Stones consisted of six stones that each had incredible power. Together Thanos could snap his fingers and do whatever he wanted with the stones. The Avengers were doing everything they could to keep the stones out of his grasp. Thanos's ultimate goal was to get all the Infinity Stones and snap half of all people to dust. He believed that was the best way to sustain life forever to get rid of overcrowding and limited resources. Obviously, this is really bad as half of the population of the universe would be killed. Ultimately after a crazy and massive fight, Thanos managed to collect all the stones and complete his mission. This was a massive plot twist as the villain actually won. However, the door was left open for one last chance to save the world. 

		<h2>Impact on Future Marvel Movies</h2>
		<p>After this movie fans were shocked. The villain had won and half the Avengers were turned to dust. However, this movie paved the way for the very last Avengers movie&colon; Avengers Endgame. Endgame received massive hype and build-up thanks to Infinity War. Endgame grossed &dollar;2.8 Billion making it the most popular Marvel movie by far. Endgame was where Thanos was finally destroyed and universe was restored. Endgame was the end of the avengers movies and signified the end of an era for Marvel movies as they turned toward new plot points.</p>
