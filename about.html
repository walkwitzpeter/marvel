		<h2>Background of Marvel Movies</h2>
		<p>This is where the Marvel Movies begin...</p>

		<p>The publishing company, Marvel, has been creating primarily comic 
		books as well as TV shows since 1939. All of these comic books and 
		TV shows are related and make up the "Marvel Universe". Starting in 2008, 
		Marvel created their first movie to digitalize their comics. Since then,
		Marvel has created 25 more movies and counting and have become incredibly
		popular throughout the world.</p>

		<p>Marvel is the highest-grossing film franchise of all time. 
		The 25 movies are listed below in release date order. 
		The correct order to watch the movies in is debated by many Marvel fans.
		Some say to watch it in release date order while others prefer following 
		the comic book timeline.</p>

		<p>Ultimately the choice is yours, and yours alone to pick which order 
		you want to watch them in (unless you are watching it with a friend, 
		then some arguing might occur). Is it potentially irresponsible to watch 
		all 25 films (totaling about 50 hours) in a movie marathon? Thatâ€™s for 
		you to decide. <!-- Peter addition - 2 --> 
		However we highly recommend doing this as it is super fun, just make sure to 
		take off of work for a day or two so that your boss doesn't question why you 
		are extremely exhausted from a weekend with no sleep. </p>

		<p>See below all the movies so far and see which ones become 
		your favorite.</p>
