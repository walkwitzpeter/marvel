			<h2>King of Wakanda</h2>
		</div>

		<p>This movie is set in Marvel's own Wakanda, Africa. It is 
		a highly advanced society that is protected and ruled by one 
		king. T'Challa, portrayed by the late Chadwick Boseman, takes 
		the place of King after his father, T'Chaka, passes away. Conflict arises as T'Challa must fight to keep his rights 
		as king, and to protect his people from being attacked. One of Wakanda's most valuable resources is a metallic 
		material known as Vibranium. It is able to absorb sound waves, 
		vibrations, as well as kinetic energy. It is the main resource
		that powers Wakanda and fuels their technology.</p>

		    </blockquote>
		  </div>
		</div>

		<p>The antagonists of the story seek to steal the Vibranium and
		sell it. T'Challa eventually partners with Agent Phil, a member
		of S.H.I.E.L.D. To be the Black Panther is simply not just a title of being
		king, it is a symbol of power and leadership. The Black Panther's
		powers are acquired via consuming a heart-shaped herb which grants
		the consumer great strength, stamina, and agility. The process
		follows several rituals, including that the individual being the
		Black Panther will enter another dimension to walk with their
		ancestors. T'Challa goes through the rituals several times
		throughout the film, each one showing how physically and 
		mentally exhausting the process is.</p>

		<!-- Peter Addition -4 -->
		<p>This movie was the highest grossing marvel movie until Avengers: Endgame 
		came out. Endgame, which was the final movie in the Avengers series, beat 
		out Black Panther by about 158 million. Although that seems like a lot 
		considering that Black Panth made about 700 million, 158 is only about a 
		25&#37; increase. Which is good but not crazy.</p>
