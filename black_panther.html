	<h1>Black Panther</h1>
	<h2>King of Wakanda</h2>

	<p>This movie is set in Marvel's own Wakanda, Africa. It is 
	a highly advanced society that is protected and ruled by one 
	king. T'Challa, portrayed by the late Chadwick Boseman, takes 
	the place of King after his father, T'Chaka, passes away. Conflict arises as T'Challa must fight to keep his rights 
	as king, and to protect his people from being attacked. One of Wakanda's most valuable resources is a metallic 
	material known as Vibranium. It is able to absorb sound waves, 
	vibrations, as well as kinetic energy. It is the main resource
	that powers Wakanda and fuels their technology.</p>

	<p>The antagonists of the story seek to steal the Vibranium and
	sell it. T'Challa eventually partners with Agent Phil, a member
	of S.H.I.E.L.D. To be the Black Panther is simply not just a title of being
	king, it is a symbol of power and leadership. The Black Panther's
	powers are acquired via consuming a heart-shaped herb which grants
	the consumer great strength, stamina, and agility. The process
	follows several rituals, including that the individual being the
	Black Panther will enter another dimension to walk with their
	ancestors. T'Challa goes through the rituals several times
	throughout the film, each one showing how physically and 
	mentally exhausting the process is.</p>

	<!-- Peter Addition -4 -->
	<p>This movie was the highest grossing marvel movie until Avengers: Endgame 
	came out. Endgame, which was the final movie in the Avengers series, beat 
	out Black Panther by about 158 million. Although that seems like a lot 
	considering that Black Panth made about 700 million, 158 is only about a 
	25&#37; increase. Which is good but not crazy.</p>
