			<h1>Black Panther</h1>
			<h2>King of Wakanda</h2>

			<p>This movie is set in Marvel's own Wakanda, Africa. It is 
			a highly advanced society that is protected and ruled by one 
			king. T'Challa, portrayed by the late Chadwick Boseman, takes 
			the place of King after his father, T'Chaka, passes away.</p>
			<p>Conflict arises as T'Challa must fight to keep his rights 
			as king, and to protect his people from being attacked.</p>
			<p>One of Wakanda's most valuable resources is a metallic 
			material known as Vibranium. It is able to absorb sound waves, 
			vibrations, as well as kinetic energy. It is the main resource
			that powers Wakanda and fuels their technology.</p>
			<p>The antagonists of the story seek to steal the Vibranium and
			sell it. T'Challa eventually partners with Agent Phil, a member
			of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>
			<p>To be the Black Panther is simply not just a title of being
			king, it is a symbol of power and leadership. The Black Panther's
			powers are acquired via consuming a heart-shaped herb which grants
			the consumer great strength, stamina, and agility. The process
			follows several rituals, including that the individual being the
			Black Panther will enter another dimension to walk with their
			ancestors. T'Challa goes through the rituals several times
			throughout the film, each one showing how physically and 
			mentally exhausting the process is.</p>
