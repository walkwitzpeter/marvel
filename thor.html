			<h1>Thor</h1>
			<h2>Norse God of Thunder and Lightening</h2>

			<p>As the son of the king of all Norse gods, Odin, Thor grows up as Prince of Asgard. His mother and Odin's wife, Frigga, plays a very influential role in helping Thor prepare to be king one day. In the movie, Asgardians, or also known as &AElig;sir, are actually a species of extraterrestrial upbringing, keeping the form of humans though. They have highly advanced technology, which tends to be seen as a high magic that makes up their world.</p>

			<p>Conflict arises and everything changes when the Frost Giants, enemies of the gods', attack. They traveled over the Bifr&ouml;st Bridge, bringing chaos and fear to the people of Asgard. Loki, God of Mischief and Thor's adopted brother, attempts to take Asgard for himself. Thor must learn the hardships of being mortal on Earth while fighting for love and family. His weapon of choice is a hammer named Mj&oslash;lnir. Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the 8&plus; movies he is scripted in, including the new upcoming film of 2022 <i>Thor&#58; Love and Thunder</i>. As for comics, Thor made his first debut in <i>Journey into Mystery</i> &num;83
			that released in 1962.</p>

			<!-- Peter Addition - 5 -->
			<p>Thor Ragnarok is probably the best movie in the Thor series, however 
			it is unfortunately only really good if you first watch the other movies. 
			However, if you don't want to watch the other movies then it is still very 
			enjoyable on its own. Therefore I would highly recommend this movie to 
			anyone who hasn't seen it.</p>
